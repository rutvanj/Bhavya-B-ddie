    <p>
      Distance is weird, it doesn’t erase anything, it just makes you miss someone in a quieter way.
      And I miss you. A lot.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’re still my safest place, my favorite thought, and the one constant that never really changed,
      even when everything else did. Some friendships fade with space… ours just learned how to survive it, ig.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope today feels like everything you ever yearn for comes alive.
      And even if I can’t be there, you should know: I’m always in your corner. Always.
    </p>

    <p>Happy birthday. Stay you. ✨</p>
